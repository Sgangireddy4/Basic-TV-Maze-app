Description

This app provides a search functionality and shows all the various TV programs with full or partial name match with the search input. The consumer can click on the resulting multi-search results (consisting of name and picture of the show) and view further details of the program of their interest. The click event causes triggering another search based on the full-name of the selected program via a service to the same API requesting single search results. Once this finishes, we initialize another component where they can see full details of the program, such as language, run time, channel it comes on, description of the show, its rating etc..The user can scrolls down to the multi-results, click on another program and view its full details.

This program hence uses three main components in the app.components, a search component with the search bar, a short-details component showing picture and name (this component is run in a ngFor loop to display as many components as the JSON response from multi-search from the API), a full details component with all details like language, rating, runtime, channel etc. There is a single service which can makes two calls to the same API for multi-search and single-search. The former gets a JSON response in the form of an array of objects, which are broken down into one interface to display a list of components (via for loop) while the second gets a single object JSON response which is converted into a different interface object. Only when the user clicks a multi-search result, this search is triggered, and when this response is received and this instance is not null, then the full-details-component is set to appear in the app-components
